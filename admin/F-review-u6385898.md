# Code Review for Adonis Mouti (u6385898)
### By Weitao Chen

#### Best Features
1. Explicit layer in coding, codes in JavaFx are 
modularised by sections, easy to be fixed or modified while 
not affecting other parts 

#### Documentation
1. Clear comments on some of the methods,
while other code blocks still need further 
explain.

#### Class and method structure
1. Class structure is clear and obvious, each method
illustrates a part of the viewer.
 

2. Most of the access of methods and classes can be set as `private` instead
of `public`.

3. Since JavaFx involves many setting steps, a method can be considered
to build for automatically setting these configures, so the code may become 
clean and concise.

#### Follows Java convention
All variables' names follows the rule of Java convention--camel naming.
